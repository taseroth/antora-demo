= System Scope and Context

This chapter describes the environment and context of <the solution>. It uses the https://c4model.com[C4 model] context diagram notation.

Data for the various aspects of the application is loaded on a monthly basis into the application and made available the business to perform analyses of their respective production chains.

For the data sources used, see [data sources] TODO.

Users will need to get authorization from the company SSO system before using the application. See [roles and rights] TODO

The system context diagram describes how the systems fits in the wider IT landscape and what other surrounding systems it interacts with.
