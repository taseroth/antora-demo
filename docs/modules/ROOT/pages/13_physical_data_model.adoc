= Physical Datamodel

This section describes the datamodel as it exists in the database, this can differ from the logical datamodel the application is using in the service layer.
This section assumes the data is stored in a Neo4j database and hence uses the property graph model.

NOTE: There are currently no known ways to generate a graphical representation of a graph property model via plantuml or similar available tooling, so the image is generated in the Neo4j browser with `call db.schema.visualization` and manually downloaded.

== Overview

For demo purposes, the datamodel from the https://github.com/taseroth/twitter-crawler[Twitter-Crawler]. This application allows to crawl the social graph from a given starting point and stores the result in a Neo4j database.
Entities in this graph represent part of the Twitter social network.
